# 0x11. Python - Network #1
## Requirements

### General

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7)
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
-   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
-   You must use [get](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/SSngTpTH6EcncejWzNjX_Q "get") to access to dictionary value by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
-   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
-   Your code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
